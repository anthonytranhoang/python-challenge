The toughest part of this python challenge was the start for me. Figuring out how to add commit push took me a while to figure out, but I eventually got it. 
Another part which took me a while to learn was adding csv files into my main.py file, the only reason I was confused was because of the '..' locating the files I thought I needed to back a folder to get into the resources folder but realised that I did not have to. 
Overall, everything else was smooth since we have learnt most of the basic functions from other lessons and besides some spacebar errors and typos. 
Showing me that coding is not easy and that little mistakes could really be time consuming.
Copy and pasting code saves a lot more time than typing it manually as sometimes manually typed code could have little errors that we cannot see like spacebar indent errors. (4 spaces per indent level)
